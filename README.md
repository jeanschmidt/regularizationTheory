regularizationTheory
====================

This folder contains a file that is used on the MlClass from prof. Ng exemplifying the 
learning regularization using covariance matrix. Also to make it more clear I added a photo
of a board showing the equation used as a learning algorithm. The only difference between this 
and the usual solution used on Ng's class is the dynamic regularization theorem used that sets
the expected noise as a penality on the learning algorithm using covariance matrix.

Unfortunitly as the copyright isn't mine I can't share with others the full source code used
to solve this problem, so one that wants to check the solution must have lesson 4 of Ng class.
I strongly recommend to subscrible on his free Machine Learning class on coursera.org.
